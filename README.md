SOLID principles:

- Single Responsibility 
	each class should have only one sole purpose and not be filled with
	excessive functionality.

- Open Close 
	classes should be open for extension,
	closed for modification. 
	In other words, you should not have to re-write an existing class for implementing new features

- Liskov Substitution
	every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for base or parent class
